**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
City Explorer is designed to consume the LocationIQ API in order to allow the user to search for a city, which returns a map of that city. It also hits a backend built in Node.js in order to pass a static array of weather data (with additional functionality coming soon)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Grab the backend server at [City Explorer API](https://github.com/vmasten/city-explorer-api)
4. Make sure to set up a `.env` file at the root of the project with an API key for LocationIQ.
5. Run `npm start` to start exploring cities!

## Architecture
Built with create-react-app, along with the react-bootstrap package and Node.js on the backend
